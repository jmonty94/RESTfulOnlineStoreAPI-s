## Overview
​
### The challenge
​The Challenge was to take a preexisiting online store backend and create the remaining routes that needed completing in order to have all the applicable API's done. The models for the appropriate datapoints also needed to be completed and connected to each other using Sequelize

​
### User Story
​
```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
​
### Acceptance Criteria
​
```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

​
## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Sequelize
- MySQL2
- Express.js
- Dotenv

​
### What I learned
​
I learned quite a bit about how Sequelize and other similar ORM's work and help make Database querying much simpler and easy to use.

​
### Continued development
​
I would like to revisit and refactor the API's that were provided already complete as I believe that they can be condensed down greatly with the use of async and await functions

​
